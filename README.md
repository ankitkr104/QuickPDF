Every major PDF tool — Smallpdf, ILovePDF, Adobe Acrobat Online — routes your files through a remote server. You upload a confidential contract, a financial statement, a medical record — and it passes through infrastructure you don't control.

**QuickPDF is different.** It processes everything 100% client-side using `pdf-lib` in the browser. Your files never leave your device. Not for a millisecond. No backend. No uploads. No data liability.

---

## Features

- **Merge PDFs** — Combine unlimited PDFs with drag-and-drop reordering
- **Split PDFs** — Extract any page range with start/end page precision  
- **Zero uploads** — All processing happens in-memory in your browser via WebAssembly
- **No watermarks** — Clean, unbranded output on every export
- **Instant** — No network round-trips; operations complete in milliseconds
- **Fully responsive** — Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js v18+

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jhasourav07/quickpdf.git
cd quickpdf

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

The `dist/` output is fully static — deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages with zero configuration.

## How It Works

QuickPDF uses [`pdf-lib`](https://pdf-lib.js.org/) — a pure JavaScript library that runs entirely in the browser with no server dependency.

**Merging**

1. Files are read as `ArrayBuffer` via the browser's native File API
2. Each PDF is loaded into a `PDFDocument` instance in memory
3. Pages are copied into a new document in the user-defined drag order
4. The merged document is serialized and triggered as a browser download — never transmitted anywhere

**Splitting**

1. User uploads a PDF; page count is extracted immediately in-memory
2. User specifies start and end pages
3. Only the selected page range is copied into a new `PDFDocument`
4. Output is downloaded directly — the original file is never modified

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Compress PDF — reduce file size without quality loss
- [ ] Rotate pages — per-page rotation controls  
- [ ] Reorder pages — visual thumbnail drag interface
- [ ] Add watermark — text or image overlay
- [ ] PDF metadata editor — title, author, keywords
- [ ] PDF → Images — export pages as PNG/JPG

## Security

QuickPDF is architected so that a breach of the application itself **cannot expose user files** — because files are never transmitted. The attack surface is limited entirely to the user's own browser session.

If you discover a vulnerability, please open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/jhasourav07/quickpdf/security/advisories/new) rather than a public issue.
